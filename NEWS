 * Actually checking in cache changes that were supposed to be in previous
   release.

1.2.6: March 10, 2008
 * Now creating a new cache connection for each usage of the cache. This will
   prevent crashes that arose when multiple threads tried to share a single
   connection. 

1.2.5: March 7, 2008
 * Fixed a database bug that could have caused a cache save before a commit.
 * Client code now only calls save_note() on the server when necessary, and
   takes startup flag into account.

 * New product tour and new screenshots.
 * Added a work-around for a database cache bug that prevented the file upload
   progress bar from showing.

   only its startup flag changed.

   necessary.

   then a new read-write notebook is created for you automatically.
 * Made use of HTML <label> tag for UI checkboxes and radio buttons.
 * Replaced a workaround for a Firefox DesignMode bug. The bug causes a jumping
   text cursor. The previous workaround involved appending <span> tags and had
   other negative side-effects. The new workaround involves removing extra <br>
   tags.

1.1.2: January 22, 2008
 * You can no longer edit notes in the trash. You have to undelete them first.
 * Fixed several race conditions between save_note() and other note-mutating
