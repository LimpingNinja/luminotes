   now excluded from the note tree's list of links.

1.4.3: June 16, 2008:

   you had a valid session. This prevented thumbnails from showing up
   if, for instance, you were reading the Luminotes blog from an RSS

 * Added some minor product page tweaks like meta description tags.

1.3.39: May 27, 2008

1.3.38: May 26, 2008

 * Made the toolbar auto-resize based on browser window size.

1.3.23: May 9, 2008
 * Fixed tools/release.sh to include an empty session directory in the
   produced tarball. Without a session directory, installing and running 
   Luminotes server would yield session deadlock errors.

1.3.22: May 8, 2008

   notebook_collaboration set to False.

 * Implemented basic user account settings. Now you can change your email
   address.
 * Fixed a bug where if you load a particular note in its own window, and
   that note is a startup note, it shows up in the note tree twice.

1.3.16: May 6, 2008
 * Fixed a bug where an invite sent for a notebook with an accented unicode
   name would cause a UnicodeEncodeError upon sending the invite email. Now
   such invites are encoded as quoted-printable UTF-8, while other invites
   continue to be 7-bit ASCII.

1.3.15: May 6, 2008
 * Fixed a bug where the "show on startup" checkbox did not appear checked if
   you created a startup note, hid it, and then opened it the note tree area.
 * Possibly fixed a bug where IE 7 would fail to download as HTML via HTTPS
   due to cache issues.

1.3.14: May 5, 2008
 * Fixed a database indexing bug that prevented notes with really long (~2700+
   character) titles from saving correctly.
 * Changed the literal quotation character in the starting wiki note to the
   "&quot;" character entity so it doesn't show up as a change in the diff.
 * Fixed a bug where attempting to load a notebook preview without access
   would give a "list index out of range" error instead of an access error.
 * Fixed a bug where the Valid_id() validator would raise a TypeError when
   given a None value. Now raising a ValueError instead.
 * Fixed a bug where saving a note unsuccessfully could cause the note's
   title to show up in the recent updates list.
 * If there is an error saving a note, then even if "hide" was clicked, the
   note is not hidden. Instead, the note stays open so that the user can try
   again.
 * Fixed a bug where renaming a note to have no title caused the title to
   show up as completely blank in the recent updates list. Now it shows up as
   "untitled note".
 * Made it clearer whether the invitee has accepted a particular invite yet.

1.3.13: May 5, 2008
 * Instructions for enabling JavaScript, linked from various forms that
   require it.

1.3.12: May 3, 2008:
 * Fixed yet another diff-breaking edge case. This one had to do with
   inserting italicized text right before some existing italicized text.

1.3.11: May 2, 2008
 * Fixed another bug that prevented diffs from working. This time, those with
   <br/> tags didn't parse correctly.

1.3.10: May 2, 2008
 * Fixed a bug that prevented diffs from working for notes with links.

1.3.9: May 2, 2008
 * When viewing a note's revision, changes since the previous revision are now
   shown in red strikeout (deletions/modifications) and green text
   (additions/modifications).

1.3.1: April 18, 2008
 * Now if you try to load a page where access is required, and you're not
   logged in, you'll be redirected to a login page. After you login, you'll
   be redirected to the page you were originally trying to access.

   revision time.

 * Made Html_cleaner strip HTML comments, which Open Office adds for styling
   purposes.

1.2.21: March 30, 2008

   cut and paste from other programs into Luminotes.

1.2.20: March 29, 2008
 * Fixed a bug in which closing a Luminotes window with an unsaved note in
   Firefox would occasionally not save it.

1.2.19: March 26, 2008
 * Increased default socket timeout so as not to timeout slow clients.

   Luminotes account and upgrade to a paid plan all at once.
 * Added some new user quotes on the front page.

1.2.17: March 18, 2008
 * Internet Explorer expects quoted download filenames, while Firefox
   doesn't. So I took that into account by quoting conditionally based on the
   detected browser.

1.2.16: March 18, 2008
 * Fixed a bug that prevented the upload of filenames with special characters
   in them.

1.2.15: March 17, 2008

   prevent crashes that arose when multiple threads tried to share a single
   connection. 

1.2.5: March 7, 2008
 * Fixed a database bug that could have caused a cache save before a commit.

   then a new read-write notebook is created for you automatically.
 * Made use of HTML <label> tag for UI checkboxes and radio buttons.
 * Replaced a workaround for a Firefox DesignMode bug. The bug causes a jumping
   text cursor. The previous workaround involved appending <span> tags and had
   other negative side-effects. The new workaround involves removing extra <br>
   tags.

1.1.2: January 22, 2008
 * You can no longer edit notes in the trash. You have to undelete them first.
 * Fixed several race conditions between save_note() and other note-mutating
