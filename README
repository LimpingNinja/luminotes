Luminotes is a WYSIWYG personal wiki notebook for organizing your notes and
ideas. For more information, see:

  http://luminotes.com/


Windows XP / Vista
------------------

To start Luminotes Desktop on Windows, just click the Start button, click on
"All Programs", and then click on "Luminotes". If you see a Windows Security
Alert about blocking Luminotes, click the "Unblock" button.

Luminotes Desktop runs inside a browser, so when you launch it, it will
open up in a new browser window or tab.

In case you're curious, your notes and attached files are stored within the
%APPDATA%\Luminotes folder in a database file.

If you'd like to run Luminotes from a USB drive, install Luminotes Desktop and
then manually copy the whole \Program Files\Luminotes folder to a USB drive.
Then, run usb_luminotes.bat from the USB drive. Your Luminotes data will be
stored on the USB drive instead of on the computer itself.


Linux / Mac OS X / BSD
----------------------

To start Lumintoes Desktop or Server on Linux or Mac OS X, please see the
INSTALL file.


User Guide
