Limited Medium is a lightweight personal wiki notebook for organizing your
notes and ideas. It's designed for:

 * Writers. Keep track of your characters, plots, and scenes.
 * Students. Take notes and make links between related concepts.
 * Game designers. Build up your world one detail at a time.
 * Creative types. If you've outgrown a Word doc or text file full of
   disorganized notes, Limited Medium can help.

Here's how Limited Medium differs from other personal wikis:

 * What you see is what you mean. You can forget about markup or markdown.
 * Integrated viewing and editing. Update any wiki entry without switching
   back and forth.
 * View multiple wiki entries at once. Perfect for notes and brainstorming.
 * Access your wiki from anywhere. All your work is automatically saved to the
   server.
 * Use any sort of link titles you want. Wiki links aren't expected to
   LookLikeThis.

Limited Medium also has the following features:

 * Built-in searching. A single search looks through every word in the entire
   wiki.

Limited Medium makes use of some advanced browser features, so not all
browsers will work for editing your wiki. Supported browsers include:

 * Internet Explorer 6+
 * Firefox 1.5+
 * SeaMonkey 1.0+
 * Iceweasel 1.5+
 * Iceape 1.0+

The following web browsers are known not to work with Limited Medium:

 * Safari
 * Opera
 * Konqueror
 * Lynx

If you're looking for a personal wiki with more minimal browser requirements,
you might want to try TiddlyWiki. If you're looking for a more general-purpose
wiki for multiple users, check out MoinMoin.

If you'd like to actually install the Limited Medium server, see the INSTALL
file.

Enjoy!
