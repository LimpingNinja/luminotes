Luminotes is a WYSIWYG personal wiki notebook for organizing your notes and
ideas. For more information, see:

Windows XP / Vista
------------------

To start Luminotes Desktop on Windows, just click the Start button, click on
"All Programs", and then click on "Luminotes". Luminotes Desktop runs inside a
browser, so when you launch it, it will open up in a new browser window or
tab.

Windows Security: The first time you start Luminotes, you may see a Windows
Security Alert about blocking Luminotes. This is basically Windows asking you
if you want to allow Luminotes to access the internet. If you click "Keep
Blocking", then that will prevent Luminotes Desktop from accessing the
internet. If you click "Unblock", then Luminotes will be able to use your
internet connection.

Right now, Luminotes does not use the internet at all. However, a future
release will include the optional ability for you to synchronize your notes
with Luminotes.com. If you plan on using this synchronization feature when
it's available, then you should click "Unblock". Otherwise, you can safely
click "Keep Blocking".

File storage: In case you're curious, your notes are stored within the
%APPDATA%\Luminotes folder in a database file. Attached files are stored with
the %APPDATA\Luminotes\files folder.

USB drive: If you'd like to run Luminotes from a USB drive, then when the
Luminotes Desktop installer prompts you to select the installation destination
location, simply select the location of your USB drive. For instance, if your
USB drive has the Windows drive letter "E:", then just enter "E:" for the
destination location.

(If you have already installed Luminotes Desktop, then you can just manually
copy the installed \Program Files\Luminotes folder to your USB drive.)

Once Luminotes Desktop is installed, instead of running Luminotes normally,
open your USB drive as a folder in Windows. Then, run usb_luminotes.bat from
the USB drive. Your Luminotes data, including all of your notes and notebooks,
will be stored on the USB drive instead of on the computer itself. Then,
anytime you want to start Luminotes on the USB drive, run usb_luminotes.bat
from it.
