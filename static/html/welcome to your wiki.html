<h3>welcome to your wiki</h3>

<p>Here's how to get started with your personal wiki notebook.</p>

<p><b>First, the basics.</b> A Limited Medium notebook is simply a collection
of linked entries, each with a unique title. Right now you're reading an entry
titled "welcome to your wiki".</p>

<p><b>To make a new wiki entry</b>, hit the "+" button on the left, or click
anywhere on the page's background. Start by typing a title for your new entry,
say, "ideas", and then press enter. Next, type the contents of your new entry,
using the formatting buttons on the left for things like bold, italics, or
lists.</p>

<p><b>To link one entry to another</b>, use the entry link button with the
arrow on it. Hit the button once, type the title of an entry you want to link
to, and then hit the button again. Or, if you've already typed some text, you
can select it with your mouse and then hit the entry link button.</p>

<p><b>To follow a link to another entry</b>, just click on it and it will open
up for you to view or edit. You can switch between entries just by clicking on
them, and hide entries simply by clicking the "hide" button.</p>

<p>That's all you need to know to get started with your personal wiki. It's
that easy. Enjoy!</p>
