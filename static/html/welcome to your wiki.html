<h3>welcome to your wiki</h3>

<p>Here's how to get started with your personal wiki notebook.</p>

<p><b>First, the basics.</b> A Luminotes wiki is simply a collection of linked
notes, each with a unique title. Right now you're reading a note titled
"welcome to your wiki".</p>

<p><b>To make a new wiki note</b>, click the "+" button on the left. Start by
typing a title for your new note and then press enter. Next, type the contents
of your new note, using the formatting buttons on the left for things like
bold, italics, or lists.</p>

<p><b>To link one note to another</b>, click the "<u>Link</u>" button on the
left, type a note title, and then click the button again. Or, you can just
highlight some text and click the "<u>Link</u>" button.</p>

<p><b>To follow a link to another note</b>, just click on the link and the
note will open up for you to view or edit. You can switch between notes simply
by clicking on them, and hide notes by clicking the "hide" button.</p>

<p><b>To save a note</b>, don't do anything! Luminotes saves your work
automatically. If you'd like a particular note to be displayed whenever you
login, select "show on startup" under options.

<p>That's all you need to know to get started with your Luminotes wiki. It's
really that easy. Enjoy!</p>
