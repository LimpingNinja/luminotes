<h3>download</h3>

<p>
First of all: <b>You don't need to download any software if you just want to
make a wiki!</b> For that, simply
<a href="/users/demo" target="_top">try the demo</a>, or
<a href="/pricing" target="_top">sign up</a> for a free account.
</p>

<p>
But if you do want to run Luminotes on your own server, here is the
necessary software:
<ul>
<li><a href="/static/luminotes.tar.gz" target="_top">Luminotes
server</a> (stable release)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It is licensed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU GPL</a>. To use
this software, you'll need a Linux machine with Python and PostgreSQL. More
details, including installation instructions, can be found within the included
INSTALL file.

If you have any problems or questions, please let me know. See my <a

<h3>source code repository</h3>

<p>
The download link above is the most recent stable release of Luminotes server.
If you're interested in getting your hands on the development version of
Luminotes, then you should use the Luminotes <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/" target="_top">Mercurial</a> source
code repository. You can either clone a local copy of the repository or just
browse the source code online:
<ul>
<li>hg clone
<a href="http://luminotes.com/hg/luminotes" target="_top">http://luminotes.com/hg/luminotes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I should emphasize that this is the development version of Luminotes. This
means it's intended for developers and likely contains untested or
unfinished features. If you want to run a production server, download the
stable release above rather than using the development version.
