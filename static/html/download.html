<h3>download</h3>

<p>
First of all: <b>You don't need to download any software if you just want to
make a wiki!</b> For that, simply
<a href="/users/demo" target="_top">try the demo</a>, or
<a href="/pricing" target="_top">sign up</a> for a free account.
</p>

<p>
But if you do want to run Luminotes on your own server, here is the
necessary software: <a href="/static/luminotes.tar.gz" target="_top">Luminotes
server</a>. It is licensed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU GPL</a>. To use
this software, you'll need a Linux machine with Python and PostgreSQL. More
details, including installation instructions, can be found within the included
INSTALL file.
