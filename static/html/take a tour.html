<h3>take a tour</h3>

<p>
Luminotes is a personal wiki designed specifically for creating highly
interconnected documents. Let's dive right into the tour so you can get a feel
for how it works.
</p>

<h3>WYSIWYG viewing and editing</h3>

<p>
If you're familiar with a traditional word processor, you'll feel right at
home with Luminotes' convenient toolbar. All of your text appears formatted as
you type it, since there's no arcane markup language. Luminotes also does away
with the edit and save buttons found in traditional wikis, so you can update
your wiki with less hassle. Just click on a note and start typing!
</p>

<p>
Making links between your notes is as easy as formatting text. Just highlight
the text you want to make into a link and click the "<u>Link</u>" button. If
you prefer, you can always use keyboard combinations for any of the toolbar
buttons.

<h3>big-picture browsing</h3>

<p>
Luminotes allows you to deal with several wiki notes all at once on the same
page, which is ideal for brainstorming or viewing several brief notes
simultaneously. As you follow links from one note to the next, you can see at
a glance how you got to the current note. And of course you can always focus
on the task at hand by hiding notes that you're done working on.
</p>

<p>
While Luminotes' big-picture browsing is plenty cool, you can always open
an individual note in its own browser window or tab. Luminotes is flexible
enough to let you browse your wiki in the way that best suits your needs
&mdash; without getting in your way.

<h3>notebook sharing and collaboration</h3>

<p>
Most of the time, you want to keep your personal wiki all to yourself. But
sometimes you simply need to share your work with friends and colleagues. So
Luminotes supports wiki sharing and collaboration. Send invites to your
friends simply by entering their email addresses, allowing them to view
or edit your wiki.
</p>

<p>
You can also download your entire wiki as HTML at any time with a single
click. This is perfect for taking your wiki on the go or sending it by email.
