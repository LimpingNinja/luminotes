<h3>upgrade</h3>

<p>
In a few short weeks, you'll be able to upgrade your Luminotes account to get
notebook sharing features and additional storage space. Here are some of the
features you can look forward to.
</p>

<h3>share your notebook</h3>

Most of the time, you want to keep your personal wiki all to yourself. But
sometimes you simply need to share your work with friends and colleagues. When
you upgrade your Luminotes account, you'll be able to invite specific people
to collaborate on your wiki simply by entering their email addresses. You can
even give them full editing capbilities, so several people can contribute to
your wiki notebook.

<h3>access control</h3>

With an upgraded Luminotes wiki, you'll decide exactly how much access to give
people. Collaborators can make changes to your notebook, while viewers can
only read your wiki. And owners have the same complete access to your notebook
that you do. When you're done collaborating, a single click revokes a user's
notebook access.
</p>

<p>
Your wiki access control works on a per-notebook basis, so you can easily
share one notebook with your friends while keeping your other notebooks
completely private.
</p>

<h3>additional storage space</h3>

<p>
An upgraded Luminotes account gets you more than just notebook sharing
features. You'll also be treated to way more room for your personal wiki. That
means you'll have more space for your notes and ideas, and you won't have to
worry about running out of room anytime soon.
</p>
