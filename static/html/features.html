Here's what makes Luminotes so great:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>viewing and editing, together at last</b><br />

With Luminotes, you can update any wiki note without having to switch to
a separate edit mode. And you can forget about markup or markdown.

<li><b>big-picture browsing</b><br />

Deal with several wiki notes all at once on the same page. Perfect for
brainstorming.</li>

<li><b>web-based goodness</b><br />

All your work is automatically saved to the server so you can access your wiki
wherever you go.</li>

<li><b>no FunnyLookingTitles</b><br />

Smashed-together titles are completely unnecessary. You're free to title your
wiki notes as you see fit.</li>

<li><b>notebook change history</b><br />

Make updates without worry. You can always go back and view older versions of
your wiki.</li>

</ul>
