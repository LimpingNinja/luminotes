Here's what makes Luminotes so great:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>viewing and editing, together at last</b><br />

With Luminotes, you can update any wiki entry without having to switch to
a separate edit mode. And you can forget about markup or markdown.

<li><b>big-picture browsing</b><br />

Deal with several wiki entries all at once on the same page. Perfect for notes
and brainstorming.</li>

<li><b>web-based goodness</b><br />

All your work is automatically saved to the server so you can access your wiki
wherever you go.</li>

<li><b>no FunnyLookingTitles</b><br />

You like spaces? So do we. Smashed together titles are completely unnecessary.
You're free to title your wiki entries as you see fit.</li>

<li><b>built-in searching</b><br />

A single search looks through every word in the entire wiki.</li>

</ul>
