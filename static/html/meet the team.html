<p>
The Luminotes team is a team of one. My name is Dan Helfman, and I'll be your
guide on this journey into the wild world of personal wikis.
</p>

<p>
I started Luminotes with one simple goal in mind: I wanted to write down my
ideas and make links between them. I wanted the process to be as streamlined
as possible. And I wanted to have fun doing it.
</p>

<p>
So I decided to write my own personal wiki. I left the corporate software
world and started writing my own software with the idea that I'd bring it
directly to the people.
</p>

<p>
I must say that I'm quite pleased with the results. I hope that by the time
you've created your own Luminotes wiki, you'll be nearly as excited about this
software as I am. (Anything more than that, and you would risk spilling coffee
on the keyboard.)
</p>

<p>
I've worked as a software developer in various capacities since the mid-90s,
in everything from the movie industry (uncredited in Stewart Little 2!) to
e-commerce (talk about excitement) to K-12 space science education (NASA
contractor). Now I'm bringing my extensive professional experience to the
world of personal wikis.
</p>

<p>
I live in Seattle, Washington with my wonderful wife and two narcoleptic cats
(brothers). In my free time, I enjoy cooking anything that isn't nailed down.
</p>

<p>
Please don't hesitate to send me an email with any comments, questions, or
recipe requests. I love to hear how people are using Luminotes. See my <a

</p>

<p>
Sincerely,<br />
Dan
