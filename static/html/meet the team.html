<h3>meet the team</h3>

<p>
The Luminotes team is a team of one. I started this project because I wanted
an easy-to-use wiki where I could gather my thoughts and make links between my
ideas. None of the existing personal wikis out there quite met my needs, so I
decided to write my own. I must say that I'm quite pleased with the results. I
hope that by the time you've created your own Luminotes wiki, you'll be as
excited about this software as I am.

<p>
I've worked as a software developer in various capacities since the mid-90s,
in everything from the movie industry to e-commerce to K-12 space
science education. Now I'm bringing my varied professional experience to the
world of personal wikis.

Please don't hesitate to send me an email with any comments or questions. I
love to hear how people are using Luminotes. See my
