<b>What about privacy?</b><br />

<p>Your interaction with Luminotes is protected by 256-bit SSL encryption, so
you don't have to worry about anyone snooping on your wiki notes. And we'll
never, ever look at the contents of your wiki or share it with anyone unless
you give us your permission or make the wiki public.</p>

<b>What about backups?</b><br />

<p>Our database is fully backed up every day, and you can even download the
entire contents of your wiki by clicking "download as html" whenever you
want.</p>

<b>Does this cost me anything?</b><br />

<p>Nope, use of your personal Luminotes wiki is completely free. In the future,
we may introduce a separate premium service with additional features. But the
features you're using now will always remain free.</p>

<b>Where's the source code?</b><br />
