<h3>about</h3>

<p>
Luminotes is a personal wiki notebook for organizing your notes and ideas.
You start out by writing down your thoughts, just like with any other
document. Then, you can easily make links between your ideas, without having
to use any special wiki markup codes. Luminotes gives you the power of a
complete wiki along with the streamlined editing of a word processor.
