<h3>about</h3>

<p>
Luminotes is a personal wiki notebook for organizing your notes and ideas.
It's designed for creating highly interconnected documents with many links
between concepts. Streamlined visual editing allows you to create your wiki
without having to use any special markup codes or switch to a separate edit
mode.

<p>
Most wikis are designed for creating one large document per page, which is
great for encyclopedias, but for your own notes that can be somewhat
unwieldy. With Luminotes, you deal with several notes all at once on the same
web page, so you get a big-picture view of what you're working on and can
easily make links from one concept to another.
