<h3>about</h3>

<p>
Luminotes is a WYSIWYG personal wiki notebook for organizing your notes and
ideas. It's designed for creating highly interconnected documents with many
links between concepts. Streamlined visual editing allows you to create your
wiki without having to use any special markup codes or switch to a separate
edit mode.

<p>
Most wikis are designed for creating one large document per page. But for your
own notes, this approach can grow rather unwieldy. With Luminotes, you deal
with several notes all at once on the same web page, so you get a big-picture
view of what you're working on and can easily make links from one concept to
another.
