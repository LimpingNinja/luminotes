<h3>contact info</h3>

<p><b>Have a question?</b> Have a comment or feature request? I'd love
to hear from you! You can contact me directly at <a
href="mailto:support@luminotes.com" target="_top">support@luminotes.com</a>.
Please note that you may receive an automated email asking you to confirm your
message.</p>

As of now, I don't offer any phone-based support, which helps keep costs down.
And there's certainly something to be said for having direct email access to
the developer of the software you're using, instead of having to wait on hold
with a corporate call center. If there's anything I can do to make Luminotes
work better for you, just let me know.
