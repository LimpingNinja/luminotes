<h3>source code</h3>

<p>
First of all: <b>You don't need to download any source code if you just want to
make a wiki!</b> For that, simply
<a href="/users/demo" target="_top">try the demo</a>,
<a href="/download" target="_top">download</a> Luminotes Desktop, or
<a href="/pricing" target="_top">sign up</a> for a free account online.
</p>

<p>
But if you do want to run Luminotes on your own server or run Luminotes
Desktop on Linux, here is the necessary software:
<ul>
<li><a href="/static/luminotes.tar.gz" target="_top">Luminotes
server</a> (stable release)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It is licensed under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GNU GPL</a>.
Installation instructions can be found within the included INSTALL file.
</p>

<p>
If you have any problems or questions, please let me know. See my <a
href="/notebooks/%s?note_id=new">contact info</a> for details.
</p>

<h3>development repository</h3>

<p>
The download link above is the most recent stable release of Luminotes.
If you're interested in getting your hands on the development version of
Luminotes, then you should use the Luminotes <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/" target="_top">Mercurial</a> source
code repository. You can either clone a local copy of the repository or just
browse the source code online:
<ul>
<li>hg clone
<a href="http://luminotes.com/hg/luminotes" target="_top">http://luminotes.com/hg/luminotes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I should emphasize that this is the development version of Luminotes. This
means it's intended for developers and likely contains untested or
unfinished features. If you want to run a production version, download the
stable release above rather than using the development version.
