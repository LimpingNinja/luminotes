<h3>advanced browser features</h3>

<p>
Luminotes makes heavy use of a browser feature called DesignMode to implement
WYSIWYG wiki editing. Unfortunately, DesignMode support is incomplete in some
browsers, so not all web browsers are supported.

<p>
Please note that since DesignMode is only used when you're editing a wiki, you
don't have to worry about DesignMode compatability when you're in read-only
mode and just viewing a wiki. So Luminotes should work in read-only mode with
just about any modern browser with support for JavaScript, cookies, and remote
scripting.
