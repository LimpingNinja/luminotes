<h3>advanced browser features</h3>

<p>
Luminotes makes heavy use of a browser feature called DesignMode to implement
"what you see is what you mean" wiki editing. Unfortunately, DesignMode
support is incomplete in some browsers like Safari. Newer versions of Safari
will feature improvements in this area, so look for Luminotes to support
Safari at some point in the future. Recent versions of the Opera web browser
do support DesignMode, so that's also a potential future addition to our list
of supported browsers.

<p>
Please note that since DesignMode is only used when you're editing a wiki, you
don't have to worry about DesignMode compatability when you're in read-only
mode and just viewing a wiki. So Luminotes should work in read-only mode with
just about any modern browser with support for JavaScript, cookies, and remote
scripting.
