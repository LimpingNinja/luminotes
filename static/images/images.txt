For the large toolbar, button dimensions are 40x40 pixels. Button fonts are
Bitstream Vera Sans (regular, bold, and mono oblique). Most buttons are at 22
pt. The link button is at 12 pt. The list buttons are at 10 pt with a -4 pixel
line spacing. Down (pressed) buttons have their text offset two pixels down
and two pixels to the right.

For the small version of the toolbar, button dimensions are 20x20 pixels.
Button fonts are Bitstream Vera Sans (regular, bold, and mono oblique). Most
buttons are at 14 pt. The link button is at 8 pt. The list buttons are at 6
pt with a -3 pixel line spacing. Down (pressed) buttons have their text offset

To make the white glowing effect (which isn't present on any buttons
currently), start with black text on a transparent background in the Gimp.
Duplicate the layer, and move that duplicate underneath the original layer.
Switch to the duplicate. Enable the "select contiguous regions" tool. Click on
the duplicate layer's background. Invert selection. Grow selection by two
pixels. Fill the entire selection with white (or whatever glow color you
want). Select none. Gaussian blur the layer with a 5x5 pixel radius.

The luminotes.ico Windows icon was created by converting favicon*.xcf to PNG with
the Gimp and then running the following command on the resulting PNGs:

icotool -c -t 0 favicon.png favicon_large.png favicon_quite_large.png -o luminotes.ico
