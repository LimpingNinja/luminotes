Buttons dimensions are 40x40 pixels.

Button fonts are Bitstream Vera Sans (regular, bold, and mono oblique). Most
buttons are at 22 pt. The link button is at 12 pt. The list buttons are at 10
pt with a -4 pixel line spacing.

To make the white glowing effect (which isn't present on any buttons
currently), start with black text on a transparent background in the Gimp.
Duplicate the layer, and move that duplicate underneath the original layer.
Switch to the duplicate. Enable the "select contiguous regions" tool. Click on
the duplicate layer's background. Invert selection. Grow selection by two
pixels. Fill the entire selection with white (or whatever glow color you
want). Select none. Gaussian blur the layer with a 5x5 pixel radius.
