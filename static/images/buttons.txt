All buttons are 48x48.

Button fonts are Bitstream Vera Sans (regular, bold, and oblique).

To make the white glowing effect, start with black text on a transparent
background in the Gimp. Duplicate the layer, and move that duplicate
underneath the original layer. Switch to the duplicate. Enable the "select
contiguous regions" tool. Click on the duplicate layer's background. Invert
selection. Grow selection by two pixels. Fill the entire selection with white.
Select none. Gaussian blur the layer with a 5x5 pixel radius.
