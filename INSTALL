To use Luminotes, please see the included README file instead of this INSTALL
file. This file contains details about installing the Luminotes server, which
you shouldn't need if you only want to make a wiki.

First, install the prerequisites:

 * Python 2.5
 * CherryPy 2.2
 * simplejson 1.3


development mode
----------------

Running the Luminotes server in development mode is convenient for testing out
changes, because it uses CherryPy's built-in web server with auto-reload
enabled, so the server will automatically reload any modified source files as
soon as they're modified.

To start the server in development mode, run:

  python2.5 luminotes.py -d

Connect to the following URL in a web browser running on the same machine:

  http://localhost:8081/


production mode
---------------

Production mode is intended for a live production web site, so you can skip
this section entirely if you don't care about running such a site. Production
mode doesn't support auto-reload, and logging goes to file (luminotes.log)
instead of the console, but performance should be better than in development
mode.

If you want to use SSL, edit config/Common.py and change the values of
luminotes.http_url and luminotes.https_url based on the domain you're using.
For instance:

  "luminotes.http_url": "http://luminotes.com",
  "luminotes.https_url": "https://luminotes.com",

Then you'll need to configure your web server to forward requests for
non-static pages to CherryPy. These instructions are for Apache, but in
theory, Luminotes should work with just about any web server.

In your Apache configuration file, enable mod_rewrite and add the following
rewrite rules:

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^/favicon.ico /path/to/luminotes/static/images/favicon.ico [L]
  RewriteRule ^/static/(.*) /path/to/luminotes/static/$1 [L]
  RewriteRule ^(.*) http://127.0.0.1:8081$1 [P]

You should change the paths to point to wherever Luminotes happens to be
installed. These rules cause Apache to serve static files itself, while
passing through requests for dynamic pages to the CherryPy web server running
locally.

To actually start the production mode server, run:

  python2.5 luminotes.py

Then you should be able to connect to the site at whatever domain you've
configured Apache to serve.


unit tests
----------

If you're interested in running unit tests, install:

  * nose 0.9.0

Then you can run unit tests by running:

  nosetests
