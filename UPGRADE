To upgrade the Luminotes database from an earlier version, manually apply each
relevant schema delta file within model/delta/

For instance, if you were upgrading from version 5.0.1 to 5.0.4, you would
apply the following deltas in order:

  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/5.0.2.sql
  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/5.0.3.sql
  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/5.0.4.sql

Any version which does not introduce a schema change does not have a
corresponding schema delta file.

Sometimes I include comments within a schema delta file with additional
manual steps you need to take.

After you've updated the schema, run the updatedb.py script:

  export PYTHONPATH=.
  python2.4 tools/updatedb.py
