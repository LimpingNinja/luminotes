To upgrade the Luminotes database from an earlier version, manually apply each
relevant schema delta file within model/delta/

For instance, if you were upgrading from version 1.0.1 to 1.0.4, you would
apply the following deltas in order:

  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/1.0.2.sql
  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/1.0.3.sql
  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/1.0.4.sql

Any version which does not introduce a schema change does not have a
corresponding schema delta file.
