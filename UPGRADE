When upgrading Luminotes, if you are using memcached, it is recommended
that you restart memcached to clear your cache.


Upgrading from Luminotes 1.5.0 or higher
----------------------------------------

If you're using Luminotes 1.5.0 or higher and you'd like to upgrade to a
newer version, Luminotes will automatically upgrade your database when
you start Luminotes after an upgrade. This means that all of your notes
and notebooks created in an older versions of Luminotes will be included
in the upgrade. You don't have to do a thing other than install the
software for the new release, and then execute the following command:

  export PYTHONPATH=.
  python2.4 tools/updatedb.py


Upgrading from Luminotes 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4
----------------------------------------------

If you're using an older version of Luminotes (prior to 1.5.0) and you'd
like to upgrade to a newer version, you'll have to perform database
upgrades manually. Below are the intructions for doing so.

To upgrade the Luminotes database from an earlier version, manually apply each
relevant schema delta file within model/delta/

For instance, if you are upgrading from version 1.3.12 to 1.5.0, you would
apply the following deltas in order:

  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/1.3.14.sql
  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/1.4.0.sql
  psql -U luminotes luminotes -f model/delta/1.5.0.sql

Any version which does not introduce a schema change does not have a
corresponding schema delta file.

IMPORTANT: Even if you are upgrading past version 1.5.0 to a newer version,
you should stop applying schema delta files after 1.5.0. This is because the
Luminotes automatic schema upgrade process will pick up after that point.

After you've updated the schema, run the updatedb.py script:

  export PYTHONPATH=.
  python2.4 tools/updatedb.py
